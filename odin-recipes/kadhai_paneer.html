        <h1>Description</h1>

        <p>
            Kadai Paneer is a popular paneer recipe where paneer and bell peppers are cooked in a spicy masala.

It is one of the most popular paneer recipes. It’s there on the menu in almost all Indian restaurants. I remember always ordering it when we ate out.

Kadai is a like a wok commonly used in Indian cooking. We use it to make stir fry and all sorts of things. We also use it for deep frying snacks and sweets.

This dish is called Kadai Paneer because it’s cooked in a kadai. But if you don’t have a kadai you can simply use a wok or any other pan. I actually did not make it in a kadai!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Do use freshly made kadai masala for this recipe. Do not use your regular masalas here. The freshly ground spices make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>If you can, do add tomato paste to the recipe. It’s a little bit but adds so much more flavor to the curry.</li>
            <li>Adding some ginger juliennes to the curry while its cooking makes it so much flavorful.</li>
            <li>Tiny bit of sugar helps in balancing the flavors.</li>
