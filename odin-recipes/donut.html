        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            
            <li>2 (.25 ounce) envelopes active dry yeast</li>
            <li>¼ cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees)</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups lukewarm milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>and much more...</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water, and let stand for 5 minutes, or until foamy.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the yeast mixture, milk, sugar, salt, eggs, shortening, and 2 cups of the flour. Mix for a few minutes at low speed, or stirring with a wooden spoon. Beat in remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough no longer sticks to the bowl. Knead for about 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Place the dough into a greased bowl, and cover. Set in a warm place to rise until double. Dough is ready if you touch it, and the indention remains.</li>
            <li>urn the dough out onto a floured surface, and gently roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut with a floured doughnut cutter. Let doughnuts sit out to rise again until double. Cover loosely with a cloth.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth. Remove from heat, and stir in hot water one tablespoon at a time until the icing is somewhat thin, but not watery. Set aside.</li>
        </ol>
